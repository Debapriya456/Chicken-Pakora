How to make Chicken Pakora in Air Fryer?


If you donâ€™t want to deep fry your Pakoras and make them healthy, you can simply air fry them. Just make the pakoras as per the recipe given below and keep aside. Make sure the batter is not runny.

Now, place an aluminum foil in the air fryer and grease it with oil. Place the pakoras on the foil and spray with some oil from the top. 

Close the fryer and cook the pakoras for about 15 to 20 minutes at 400 F. 

After about 10 minutes, remove the foil and let the pakoras cook directly on the basket. It will make the pakoras more crunchy and crispy. Once ready, serve hot.
